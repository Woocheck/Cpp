Implement Matrix<N, M, T> (order is random here!)

N - number of rows
M - number of columns
has templated copy ctor ( const Matrix<N1, M1, T1>& )
​N1 < N
M1 < M
T1 convertible to T 
has operators:
​operator<<
operator[]
template operator+ (const Matrix<N1, M1, T1>)
is specialized for N = 0 && M = 0 (cannot be created)
is specialized for bools!! (std::vector<bool> is pure evil!)
